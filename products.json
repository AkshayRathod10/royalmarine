Our experience from more than 20,000 seawater analyses has enabled us to further optimize the recipe of the successful Essentials. Essentials pro supplies your aquarium not only with all major elements (incl. KH, Ca and Mg), but also with all essential trace elements (e.g. iron, iodine, molybdenum, manganese, vanadium and zinc) and helps to keep them continuously in the optimal concentration range. With Essentials pro you replace 3 x 10 liters of conventional element supply. All relevant elements are already premixed in the two Essentials pro bottles. The concentrate in laboratory quality can also be dosed immediately and does not have to be diluted. Your reef aquarium is a unique aquatic ecosystem containing many different organisms. All these organisms continuously extract substances from the aquarium water in order to be able to grow. By supplying your aquarium with Essentials pro you are able to balance the typical consumption of the reef inhabitants according to demand and consumption. In this way natural water values are continuously maintained, which is the cornerstone for every successful reef aquarium. The production of our water care products is subject to strict monitoring by our own laboratory. Quality assurance helps us to select the purest raw materials and leads to a top-quality end product. With Essentials pro you get one of the purest products available on the market for supplying reef aquariums. Usually the essentials pro are consumed to the same extent. In this case, the dosage of Essentials pro 1 and 2 can be adjusted using the KH consumption of your tank.

Many fish, especially wrasse, have a tendency to jump from the tank when frightened or chased by another fish and so a solution to preventing the loss of such fish should be high on every fish keepers priority list. D-D Jumpguard covers are a very lightweight, sleek, low visual impact and easy to construct screen cover suitable for most aquarium types, specifically designed to prevent fish loss due to jumping whilst maintaining high light penetration. The special extruded aluminium profile is now shaped with a lip which sits directly onto the edge of the glass, removing the requirement for any additional clips or brackets. The section is extruded then powder coated in a tough, low sheen, black finish for greater scratch resistance and greater aesthetics. The lower section of the corners is specifically designed so that it does not interfere with the silicone bead in the corners of your tank which gives a tight fit to the glass with no gaps. It also makes it easier and neater to cut off the corner if you want to bring wires out at the back of the tank for pumps and heaters. For those concerned with loss of light penetration into your reef tanks, we tested light levels with a Apogee MQ-200 meter and got the following results: PAR without cover around 390 \u2013 400 PAR with cover around 380 \u2013 390 Approximately a 2.5% reduction in light with no shadowing at all.\nD-D Aqua Jumpguard Pro \u2013 75\u00d775, 120\u00d775, 180\u00d790.\n\n\n"},"45":{"No":"45","product_name":"Dual Nozzel Lock Line","price":"\u20b9650.00","category":"ACCESSORIES","image":"61b-JFDxhRL._AC_SL1500_-598x459.jpg","description":"\nnozzel for aqurium\n"},"46":{"No":"46","product_name":"Filter Socks 200 Micron","price":"\u20b9250.00","category":"WATER FILTERATION & TREATMENT","image":"511ou-jarL._SX342_.jpg","description":""},"47":{"No":"47","product_name":"Flipper Deepsea Max Magnifer","price":"\u20b94455.00","category":"CLEANING TOOLS","image":"max-598x598.jpg","description":"\nFL!PPER Aquarium Product\u2019s DeepSee MAX MAGNIFIED Magnetic Aquarium Viewer \u2013 5\u2033 * Optical grade magnifying lens with 5\u2033 viewing portal is perfect for aquarium photography with focal range approximately 6 to 12 inches. * Held in place by strong rare earth magnets for use on tanks up to 3\/4\u2033 (20mm) tank wall thickness * Easily moves around the tank for viewing from any location * Great at checking for any early signs of disease or pests on your reef coral or fish! * Designed for Larger tanks * DeepSee is Safe for both glass and acrylic!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n"},"48":{"No":"48","product_name":"Flipper Deepsea Standard Magnifier","price":"\u20b92950.00","category":"CLEANING TOOLS","image":"standard-598x598.jpg","description":"\n\nOptical grade magnifying lens with 4\u2033 viewing portal is perfect for aquarium photography with focal range approximately 3 to 8 inches.\nHeld in place by strong rare earth magnets for use on tanks up to 5\/8\u2033 (16mm) tank wall thickness\nEasily moves around the tank for viewing from any location\nGreat at checking for any early signs of disease or pests on your reef coral\u00a0 or fish!\nDeep See is Safe for both glass and acrylic aquariums!\n\n"},"49":{"No":"49","product_name":"Flipper Max Replacement Blades","price":"\u20b91375.00","category":"CLEANING TOOLS","image":"efidjhewifh.jpg","description":"\nFL!PPER make replacement blade\n"},"50":{"No":"50","product_name":"Flipper Max-Flt Glass Cleaner Up To 20Mm","price":"\u20b96545.00","category":"CLEANING TOOLS","image":"81rw7QdGYaL.jpg","description":"\nFor Glass and Acrylic Tanks Up to 3\/4\u2033 (19mm) Thickness Scrub, Flip, Scrape, and Now *FLOAT* with the patented FL!PPER Aquarium Cleaner.

See below for best practices when using RPM.\nWhen mixing Fritz Reef Pro Mix, it is best to use RO\/DI water quality checked by a TDS meter (TDS should be less than 10 ppm, 0 is preferred). Fill a clean mixing container (dedicated to saltwater mixing only) with desired amount of water to be prepared. For best results, use water between 70\u00b0-75\u00b0F (21\u00b0-24\u00b0C) when mixing RPM. Slowly add desired amount of RPM to the water to avoid an increase in temperature and precipitation. This helps to prevent precipitation of calcium, alkalinity and other elements. It is recommended to use a mixing pump and an airstone when mixing RPM. This will also help to avoid concentrated areas of material and precipitation. Using a properly calibrated refractometer, bring the water to the desired salinity. Once mixed to a clear solution, add a heater to the water to bring to the current temperature of your aquarium. It is recommended to allow two hours before performing a water change. If water does not mix clear, please contact us for further mixing tips before performing a water change.\nDO NOT MIX DRY SALT DIRECTLY INTO SYSTEMS WITH LIVESTOCK PRESENT!\nCAUTION: Keep out of reach of children. Not for human consumption. Generates slight heat when added to water; avoid handling with wet hands. Contact with dry powder may cause skin and\/or eye irritation. In case of contact, flush eyes with cool water and seek immediate medical attention.\nStorage: Store in a cool, dry place.

In the absence of adequate magnesium ions, calcium and carbonate ions bond rapidly, depleting their concentrations in the system and creating the false impression that heavier supplementation is required to re-establish the desired concentrations. No matter how much calcium is added, its natural seawater concentration of 412 ppm will never be sustained until the magnesium concentration begins to approach 1, 290 ppm. Once the balance between calcium and magnesium has been established, subsequent calcium supplementation yields immediate positive results. Keeping magnesium within a range of 1, 290-1, 320 ppm will maintain the desired balance, and provides enough of the element to reef-building organisms for the formation of aragonite ( 0. 10% Mg by weight). The rate at which magnesium is extracted from the water is determined by the stocking density of reef-building livestock, type of lighting, and other conditions; therefore, each aquarium will have different requirements for the rate of magnesium supplementation. Once the rate of magnesium uptake in the aquarium has been determined, the proper dosing rate of this product can be easily calculated. It is recommended that a quality salt mix with the proper (not augmented) alkalinity and concentrations of major, minor, and trace elements be used to establish natural seawater parameters in the reef aquarium, providing a stable ionic foundation on which to build.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant information\n\nBasic: Shake product well before using. Add 5 ml (1 capful) of product per 20 US-gallons of aquarium water every other day or as needed to maintain the magnesium concentration within a range of 1,290 \u2013 1,320 ppm. When used in this fashion, 250 ml treats up to 1,000 US-gallons (3,785 L). Advanced: Determine the magnesium concentration in the aquarium using an accurate test kit before supplementing. Shake this product well before using. Each ml of Magnesion will increase the concentration of magnesium (\u201c[Mg2+]\u201d) in 1 US-gallon (3.785 L) of water by 26 ppm. If the initial [Mg2+] in the aquarium is below 1,288 ppm, add this product at the maximum rate of 10 ml per 20 US-gallons daily until the desired concentration is attained, then dose daily or weekly as needed (see below). Always try to maintain the [Mg2+] within a range of +\/-10 ppm. To determine the dosing rate of this product once the desired [Mg2+] has been acquired, measure the daily rate of magnesium uptake (i.e. the decrease in magnesium) in your aquarium by measuring the aquarium\u2019s [Mg2+] at the same time each day over a one- to two-week period. To determine the daily dosing rate (preferable to weekly dosing) for magnesium maintenance: estimate the volume of water in the entire aquarium system; divide the daily decrease in [Mg2+] by 26; multiply this number by the volume of water in the system to get the daily dosage required (ml) to maintain a stable [Mg2+]. Daily dosing maintains a more stable [Mg2+] (and more natural environment) than dosing weekly, in which the [Mg2+] spikes just after dosing and then gradually decreases throughout the course of the week.

Not for human consumption.\n\n\n\n"},"85":{"No":"85","product_name":"Mantis Bio-Filter Blocks","price":"\u20b91600.00","category":"WATER FILTERATION & TREATMENT","image":"bio-filter-blocks-598x598.jpg","description":"\nInert ceramic material with open flow architecture and largest use-able surface area.

Simultaneous use with MicroBacter Clean will have a very synergistic effect. If using with MicroBacter Clean, add it first and then wait several hours to add the Razor Marine. Active protein skimming and sensible feeding should be the first steps taken to minimize turbidity and the concentration of dissolved organic materials in any marine aquarium. Water of high clarity that is low in dissolved organic material and possesses the proper parameters is the basis for a healthy aquarium system! Razor Marine is slow acting and may require multiple applications to achieve the effect desired by the user. Used as directed, it is safe for marine fishes, hard and soft corals, and other inverts, as well as most macro-algae, however, as all animals are individuals, and water conditions vary in many aquariums, animals should be observed closely during use, for signs of stress (corals closing and not re-opening, erratic behavior etc.). If signs of stress occur, or if macro-algae are affected negatively, reduce or discontinue use as necessary.
